# Hotel-Operations-SQL

This project focuses on analyzing customer feedback data for a major hotel chain, LuxurStay Hotels, to identify issues with slow room service in some branches. Specifically, it involves:

1. Data Cleaning and Validation: Verifying the branch table data against known issues and cleaning it by imputing missing values and correcting inconsistencies.

2. Analyzing Service Response Times: Calculating average and maximum response times for each service and hotel branch to identify potential areas for improvement.

3. Targeting Improvement Efforts: Focusing on "Meal" and "Laundry" services in Europe (EMEA) and Latin America (LATAM) based on management priorities.

4. Identifying Low-Performing Hotels: Determining service and branch combinations with average ratings below the target of 4.5 for further investigation.

Overall, the project aims to use data analysis to pinpoint weaknesses in specific hotel services and locations, allowing LuxurStay Hotels to address customer concerns and enhance their service quality.
