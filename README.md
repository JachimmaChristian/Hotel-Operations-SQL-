# Hotel-Operations-SQL

This project focused on analyzing customer feedback data for a major hotel chain, LuxurStay Hotels, to identify issues with slow room service in some branches. 

### Project Steps:

1. **Data Cleaning and Validation:** I performed a column-by-column inspection of the data and cleaned it by imputing missing values and correcting inconsistencies.

2. **Analyzing Service Response Times:** Calculated average and maximum response times for each service and hotel branch to identify potential areas for improvement.

3. **Targeting Improvement Efforts:** Focusing on "Meal" and "Laundry" services in Europe (EMEA) and Latin America (LATAM) based on management priorities.

4. **Identifying Low-Performing Hotels:** Determined service and branch combinations with average ratings below the target of 4.5 for further investigation.

Overall, I leveraged my data analytics skills to pinpoint weaknesses in specific hotel services and locations, allowing LuxurStay Hotels to address customer concerns and enhance their service quality.
